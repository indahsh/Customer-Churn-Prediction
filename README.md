# CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS
<p align="justify">
  This project uses Python programming language/Google Colab to process data. I completed this project while participating in Fresh Graduate Academy at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/indahsh/details/education/968984033/multiple-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAADQ0K_IBB-BflJ1wnBkU3Z47qF6xVW9xyvI&treasuryMediaId=1714306461924">Digital Talent Scholarship</a>.

## BUSINESS PROBLEM
<p align="justify">
  Telecommunication companies are increasing because the use of the internet in communication is increasing, which can result in competition between providers. Customers have the right to choose the appropriate provider and can switch from the previous provider which is defined as customer churn. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Switching providers by customers can result in reduced revenue for telecommunications companies. By using existing datasets, it is expected to produce customer churn predictions so that companies can create business strategies so that customers survive.
