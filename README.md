# CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS
<p align="justify">
  This project uses Python programming language/Google Colab to process data. I completed this project while participating in Fresh Graduate Academy at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/indahsh/details/education/968984033/multiple-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAADQ0K_IBB-BflJ1wnBkU3Z47qF6xVW9xyvI&treasuryMediaId=1714306461924">Digital Talent Scholarship</a>.

## BUSINESS PROBLEM
<p align="justify">
  Telecommunication companies are increasing because internet use in communication is expanding, which can result in competition between providers. Customers can choose the appropriate provider and switch from the previous provider, defined as customer churn. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
  Switching providers by customers can result in reduced revenue for telecommunications companies. Using existing datasets is expected to produce customer churn predictions so companies can create business strategies for customers to survive.
